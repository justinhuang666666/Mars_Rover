# Mars_Rover_2022
1.Introduction
This project aims to design and construct a Mars rover for extra-terrestrial exploration. The rover system must be able to navigate itself in the test arena and build a map indicating the locations of aliens and their underground power infrastructure. The rover system must also autonomously avoid the alien and the infrastructure while running. In addition, the real-time system status should be displayed on the web application. The web application should have the capability of controlling the Rover remotely. Furthermore, there must be a system for powering the Rover from solar energy for long-term sustainable operation on Mars.
